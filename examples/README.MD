# Guide:

When you run the `main.py` file you will see four common types of `FrostedGlass` implementations:
- STATIC → static `FrostedGlass` and static `background`
- MOVING BACKGROUND → static `FrostedGlass` and moving `background`
- MOVING FrostedGlass → `FrostedGlass` moving with a static `background`
- INSIDE MODALVIEW → `FrostedGlass` inside `ModalView`.

The main intention is to give a basic idea of how to combine `FrostedGlass` with the rest of the UI. These are just some of the many possible combinations you can make. *The creativity is yours!*

An FPS meter (`fps_monitor.py`) will also be imported and used to display the current FPS of the UI. But attention, its use is indicated only for development purposes and contribution to the `FrostedGlass` project widget. For final product uses, perform conventional import and use as described on the project homepage: [*Import and Usage*](https://github.com/kivy-garden/frostedglass/blob/develop/README.md#import)

### For contributors:

The contents of this folder are ready to be used on any platforms supported by Kivy. The FPS indicator will be imported and used automatically as mentioned above and will help you to track the performance of the UI while improving the quality, usability and performance of the `FrostedGlass` widget. The contents of this folder will help you improve `FrostedGlass`, but you don't have to limit yourself to it, of course!
