# FrostedGlass

**FrostedGlass** is a widget with translucent frosted glass effect, that
creates a context with the background behind it.

The effect created is based on the widget/layout passed in as the background.
You can control the blur size, saturation, luminosity, overlay color, noise
opacity, border radius and the outline (color and width).

## Install
    pip install kivy_garden.frostedglass

## Import

**_python_ import:**

    from kivy_garden.frostedglass import FrostedGlass

**or _kvlang_ import:**

    #: import FrostedGlass kivy_garden.frostedglass

## Usage

*FrostedGlass* will apply the effect to the background passed to it. Make sure you assign the correct id of the widget/layout that is behind *FrostedGlass* to the `background` property.

## Example:

FrostedGlass:
    pos_hint: {'center_x': 0.5, 'center_y': 0.5}
    size_hint: (None, None)
    size: (180, 130)
    background: bg_image

    overlay_color: "#FFB9008C"
    noise_opacity: 0.15
    border_radius:  dp(0), dp(100), dp(0), dp(100)
    outline_color: "#000000"
    outline_width: 1.2
    Label:
        text: 'FrostedGlass'
        pos_hint: {'center_x': 0.5, 'center_y': 0.5}
        bold: True
        color: 'black'
        font_size: dp(25)
```

## Overview of *FrostedGlass* creation process

To reach the final result of the **FrostedGlass** widget, the steps described in the image below are followed:

## Features

FrostedGlass is efficient and makes internal optimizations to deliver the best performance while maintaining the quality of the effect, regardless of implementation, for all platforms supported by Kivy.

Overview:

- Automatic effect update, with auto bind to background properties.
- Updates effect only when needed. The effect update will only occur when some background or FrostedGlass property requires the update.
- Avoid unnecessary computation of the effect. If any FrostedGlass widget is not visible, it will not be updated.
- Full control over FrostedGlass properties. The widget is not limited to the frosted glass effect, it can be used simply as an option to achieve gaussian blur of some "background".

## Guidelines

The FrostedGlass widget is designed to update the effect whenever there is a change to its properties or background properties that requires an effect update, to keep the effect in sync with the background. 

But if it doesn't, you can call the `update_effect()` method manually to update the effect.

If calling the `update_effect()` method did not update the effect, you may need to call the `refresh_effect()` method.

## **API**

    background

> Target widget/layout that will be used as a background to **FrostedGlass**.
> The recomended way to pass the widget is through the widget/layout **id**.
> 
> `background` is defaults to `None`.

<br/>

    blur_size

> Size of the gaussian blur aplied to the background.

‚ùóÔ∏è*Note: Do not pass relative values such as **dp** or **sp**. **FrostedGlass** already
    manages this automatically, according to the device's screen density.*

> `blur_size` is defaults to `25`.

<br/>

    saturation

> Saturation boost that will be aplied to the background.
> 
> `saturation` is defaults to `1.2`.

<br/>

    luminosity

> Luminosity boost that will be aplied to the background.
> 
> `luminosity` is defaults to `1.3`.


<br/>

    overlay_color

> Color/tint overlay that will be aplied over the background.
> 
> `overlay_color` is defaults to `[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.35]`.

<br/>

    noise_opacity

> Opacity of the noise texture layer.
> 
> `noise_opacity` is a defaults to `0.08`.

<br/>

    border_radius

> Specifies the radius used for the rounded corners clockwise:
> top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left.
> 
> `border_radius` is defaults to `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.

<br/>

    outline_color

> Outline color.
> 
> `outline_color` is defaults to `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.

<br/>

    outline_width

> Outline width.
> 
> `outline_width` is defaults to `1`.

<br/>

    update_effect()

> Updates the effect only once with each method call.

‚ùóÔ∏è*Note: Use this method to update the effect only if **FrostedGlass** doesn't update automatically.*

<br/>

    refresh_effect()

> Updates the effect only once with each method call. Sould be used as an alternative, when `update_effect()` doesn't update the effect totally.

‚ùóÔ∏è*Note: Use this method to update the effect only if **FrostedGlass** doesn't update automatically and `update_effect()` was not enough to update the effect.*

CI
--

Every push or pull request run the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/kivy-garden/flower/actions) CI.
It tests the code on various OS and also generates wheels that can be released on PyPI upon a
tag. Docs are also generated and uploaded to the repo as well as artifacts of the CI.
